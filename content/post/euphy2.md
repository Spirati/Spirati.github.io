Euphy2 is a Discord bot I wrote with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) designed to let users (particularly those in the transgender and nonbinary communities, as well as those questioning) try new names and pronouns quickly and easily.

It is the direct successor to a more prototypical version of the same concept, [EuphoriaBot](https://github.com/Spirati/EuphoriaBot), with more optimized code, more focused features, and a cleaner environment for anyone who might wish to contribute.

To find out more, head to its [tutorial page]({{<ref "/projects/euphy2.md">}}) or check out its [source code](https://github.com/Spirati/Euphy2).
