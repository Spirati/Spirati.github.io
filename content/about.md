Hey there! My name is **Lynne** *(pronouns she/they)*, and I'm a backend dev with experience in a number of languages, including fluency in Python, proficiency in server-side JavaScript (Vue.js, Next.js, Express), light experience in C# and Unity, C++, and more. I work on a lot of projects involving the web, most notoriously [Discord bots]({{<ref "/tags/discord">}}) and various sysadmin-related tasks (managing servers, DNS administration, web hosting, etc).

I promise this isn't just a sneaky resum√©! Beyond just my misadventures in compsci, I spend a lot of time [playing games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/spirati) and [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/zlrb294x8puq8a2iek8buqf3j?si=QEBiMmLLS6qYlD0XS8DlbQ). If you want to check out what I've been working on or chat with me over the internet, check out the links in the footer! I promise I don't bite.
